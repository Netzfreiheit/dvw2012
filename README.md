### Credits 
Project by [Initiative f√ºr Netzfreiheit](https://netzfreiheit.org). Inspired and forked of the [digital freedom barometer](http://www.digitalevrijheidswijzer.nl/) of our friends [Bit's of Freedom](https://www.bof.nl). 

##How it works

index.html contains the comparison table and links to sections with detail information in the same document. If we have javascript on the browser the anker click event is captured and a dialog with the same information will open instead. Our fork added questions for each topic (because we didn't analyzed the election programms) so answers and questions in UL's are combined also by javascript. 

### Setup


Simple client only HTML, css and some minor javascript.
